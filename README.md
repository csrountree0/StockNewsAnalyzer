# ðŸ“ˆðŸ“° Stock News Analyzer

A web app that demonstrates how news headlines affect stock prices. Users can input a stock ticker and a date, and the app pulls historical stock data and related news articles, then uses a financial NLP model (FinBERT) to analyze article sentiment. The app visualizes price movement and correlates it with news sentiment to highlight potential market-moving headlines.
